# Discourse Theme

This CLI contains helpers for creating [Discourse themes](https://meta.discourse.org/c/theme) and theme components.

## Installation

To install the CLI use:

    $ gem install discourse_theme

## Why this gem exists?

This gem allows you to use your editor of choice when developing Discourse themes and theme components. As you save files the CLI will update the remote theme or component and changes to it will appear live!

## Usage

For help run:

```
discourse_theme
```

### `discourse_theme new PATH`

Creates a new blank theme. The CLI will guide you through the process.

### `discourse_theme download PATH`

Downloads a theme from the server and stores in the designated directory.

### `discourse_theme watch PATH`

Monitors a theme or component for changes. When changed the program will synchronize the theme or component to your Discourse of choice.

### `discourse_theme upload PATH`

Uploads a theme to the server. Requires the theme to have been previously synchronized via `watch`.

### `discourse_theme rspec PATH`

Runs the [RSpec](https://rspec.info/) system tests under the `spec` folder in the designated theme directory.

On the first run for the given directory, you will be asked if you'll like to use a local Discourse repository to run the tests.

If you select 'Y' and proceeds to configure the path to the local Discourse repository, the tests will be ran using the local Discourse development environment provided by the local Discourse repository. Note that you'll have to set up the local test environment before
the tests can be ran successfully.

If the 'n' option is selected, the tests will run in a Docker container created using the [`discourse/discours_test:release`](https://hub.docker.com/r/discourse/discourse_test) Docker image. Note that this requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to be installed.

When the `--headless` option is used, a local installation of the [Google Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is required.

Run `discourse_theme --help` for more usage details.
